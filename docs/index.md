# Welcome

This website provides **open teaching resources** for my courses and workshops. The goal is to prepare and share material that is clear, practical, and useful for engineering students and anyone interested in learning. All course content is written in Markdown and published openly to encourage reuse and self-study. If you have questions, suggestions, or feedback, feel free to contact me.
