# Design Tools And Laboratory Engineering - Coding

_Course Number M24.0862104_<br>
_WS 2025/26_

## Welcome to the Course ðŸš€

This course is an introduction to Professional Developer Tools and Workflows.
It is designed for hands-on Master students in engineering disciplines:

- Embedded Systems Engineering
- Power Electronics Engineering
- System Test Engineering

!!! note "Our goal"

    Get bootstraped into the world of software development with the basic toolset.

## Why this course?

Modern engineering requires more than theory:

- Projects are developed in teams, not alone.
- Source code is managed, versioned, and reviewed.
- Debugging, testing, and automation are daily tasks.
- Knowing the right tools saves time and frustration.

This course gives you the toolbox and mindset to succeed.

## Course Structure

We have 10 units (2 blocks Ã— 5 sessions).
Each unit is 45 minutes of (minimal) theory, live demos, and hands-on exercises.

### Block 1: Tools & Workflow

1. Linux Basics & the Terminal
2. The Shell â€“ Essential Commands
3. tmux â€“ Work like a Pro
4. neovim & VSCode â€“ Your Coding Environment
5. Git & First C++ Project

### Block 2: C++ & Engineering Projects

6. C++17 Basics & CMake
7. STL and Data Structures
8. Object-oriented programming
9. Testing and Debugging
10. Mini Project & Wrap-up

## What you will learn

By the end of this course you will:

- Navigate Linux and the terminal with confidence.
- Manage code with Git and collaborate in teams.
- Build and structure C++ projects using CMake.
- Apply STL containers and write clean C++17 code.
- Debug systematically and write simple automated tests.
- Develop a small engineering project from start to finish.

## Our Learning Style

- Hands-on first: you learn by doing.
- Mini-exercises in every session.
- Work in teams
- Mistakes are part of learning â†’ we debug together.
- Focus on professional workflows youâ€™ll use in industry.

ðŸ‘‰ Be ready to open your terminal, code, and experiment.
This course is not about slides â€” itâ€™s about practice.
