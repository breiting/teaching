AGENDA
---

- What is Git?
- History and motivation
- Key concepts: repo, commit, branch, remote
- First Git commands
- Working with remotes (GitHub/GitLab)
- Mini exercises

What is Git?
---

- A distributed version control system (VCS)
- Tracks changes in files (mostly source code)
- Allows collaboration, history, and backups
- Invented by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for Linux kernel
- The name? British slang for "unpleasant person" â€“ Linus being ironic

Why Git?
---

- No more "final_v2_neu.cpp"
- History of every change
- Work in parallel on different features
- Collaboration across teams
- Safe backups

Git Concepts
---

- **Repository (repo)**: project folder + .git directory
- **Commit**: snapshot of changes
- **Branch**: parallel line of development
- **Remote**: server version (GitHub, GitLab)
- **Clone**: copy remote repo locally

Create a New Repo
---

```bash
git init
git status
echo "Hello Git" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Tracking Changes
---

```bash
git status         # show modified files
git diff           # show changes
git add file.cpp   # stage changes
git commit -m "Describe your change"
```

Working with Remotes
---

- Connect local repo to a server (GitHub/GitLab)

```bash
git remote add origin <url>
git push -u origin main
git pull origin main
git clone <url>
```

.gitignore
---

- Tell Git which files NOT to track
  Example `.gitignore`:

```
*.o
*.log
build/
```

# Viewing History

```bash
git log
git log --oneline --graph
```

Mini-Exercises
---

# Exercise 1

1. Create a new folder and initialize a Git repo
2. Add a file `hello.txt` and commit it
3. Edit `hello.txt` and commit the change
4. Inspect history with `git log`

# Exercise 2

1. Clone an existing repository from Github

```bash
git clone https://github.com/breiting/devbox-cpp
```

# Exercise 3 (requires a Github account)

1. Create a new repo on GitHub
2. Link your local repo with remote (`git remote add origin ...`)
3. Push your commits to GitHub
4. Clone the repo into a new directory to verify

Survival Package (Git Basics)
---

- `git init, git status, git add, git commit -m`
- `git log, git diff`
- `git remote add origin, git push, git pull, git clone`
- `.gitignore`

Wrap-Up
---

- Learned what Git is and why it matters
- Created first local repo
- Connected to a remote repo
- Practiced committing and pushing

Next Session
---

- Advanced Git: branching, merging, conflicts
- Stash and blame
