AGENDA
---

- Streams, Pipes & Redirects
- Essential tools: `grep`, `find`, `sed`, `ack`
- `tmux` basics
- `neovim` introduction
- Mini exercises

Streams in Linux
---

- stdin (0) â†’ input
- stdout (1) â†’ normal output
- stderr (2) â†’ error output
- Redirection:
  ```bash
  command > file   # stdout to file (overwrite)
  command >> file  # append stdout to file
  command < file   # use file as input
  ```

Pipes
---

- Combine commands using `|`

```bash
ls -l | grep ".cpp"
ps aux | grep firefox
dmesg | less
```

Tool: grep
---

- Search for text patterns in files

```bash
grep main "*.cpp"
grep -i "error" /var/log/syslog
```

Tool: find
---

- Search for files by name, type, size

```bash
find . -name "*.cpp"
find /etc -type f -size +1M
```

Tool: sed
---

- Stream editor for search/replace

```bash
sed 's/foo/bar/g' file.txt
```

Tool: ack (if installed)
---

- Like grep, but optimized for source code

```bash
ack "main"
```

Mini-Exercises
---

# Exercise 1

- Redirect the output of `ls -l` into a file called `listing.txt`
- Append a second listing to the same file
- Use `grep` to search for `.txt` entries

# Mini-Exercise 2

- Use `find` to locate all `.log` files in `/var/log`
- Replace the word "TODO" with "DONE" in a test file using `sed`

tmux Basics
---

- Terminal multiplexer
- Keep sessions running in background
- Key bindings (default prefix: `Ctrl-b`):
  - `%` split vertically
  - `"` split horizontally
  - `o` switch pane
  - `d` detach session
- Reattach: `tmux attach`

neovim Introduction
---

- Modal editor (Normal, Insert, Command modes)
- Basic commands:
  - `i` â†’ insert mode
  - `Esc` â†’ back to normal mode
  - `:wq` â†’ save and quit
  - `/pattern` â†’ search
  - `dd` delete line
  - `yy` yank (copy), `p` paste
  - `u` undo

Mini-Exercises
---

# Exercise 3

1. Open a tmux session
2. Split the screen into two panes
3. In the left pane, open a file with `nvim`
4. In the right pane, run `ls -l` and `grep`

Survival Package (Tools & Workflow)
---

- Pipes and redirection: `|`, `>`, `>>`
- grep, `find`, `sed`, `ack`
- tmux: sessions, splits, detach/attach
- neovim: insert, save, quit, navigation, search, undo

# Wrap-Up

- Learned how to combine commands with pipes
- Practiced essential search & replace tools
- Worked with tmux splits
- Got comfortable editing in neovim

# Next Session

- Git basics: init, add, commit
- Connecting to remotes
- Push & pull

Other Shell Commands
---

```bash
export     # sets an environment variable
echo $PATH # print an environment variable
./<cmd>    # executes an application in the current dir
find       # find files
grep       # search in files
sed        # modify files
chmod      # change file attributes
```

ðŸ‘‰ Exercise:

- Create a folder unit1
- Inside, create a file with echo "hello" > hello.txt

Viewing Files
---

```bash
cat file.txt # show whole file
more file.txt # scroll page by page
tail file.txt # show last lines
```

ðŸ‘‰ Exercise: Write a log file with

```
dmesg > syslog.txt
```

View first and last lines of syslog.txt.

neovim as your editor
---

# Overview

- Neovim = modern Vim
- Fast, keyboard-driven
- Great for coding in C++

# Core keys

- i â†’ insert mode
- Esc â†’ back to normal mode
- :w â†’ save
- :q â†’ quit

ðŸ‘‰ Exercise:

- Open hello.txt in neovim
- Add your name to the file
