Why Linux & the Terminal?
---

- Most engineering tools run best on Linux
- The **shell** = your universal remote for the computer
- Terminal = efficiency, automation, reproducibility
- Professional developers **live in the terminal**
- Editing, compiling, debugging â†’ all faster

Starting the VM
---

- Start **VirtualBox** â†’ load the provided VM
- Log in with given username & password
- Explore:
  - **Desktop** (graphical view)
  - **Terminal** (command line interface)

ðŸ‘‰ **Exercise**: Open a terminal window!

First Shell Commands

cd dir/    # change directory
mkdir lab1 # make new directory
cp a b     # copy file
mv a b     # move/rename
rm file    # remove
man ls     # manual page for ls
```

ðŸ‘‰ Exercise:

- Create a folder unit1
- Inside, create a file with echo "hello" > hello.txt

Viewing Files

```bash
cat file.txt # show whole file
more file.txt # scroll page by page
tail file.txt # show last lines
```
